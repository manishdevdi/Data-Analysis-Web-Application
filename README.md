# Data Analysis Web Application

This repository contains a web application built with Streamlit in Python, designed to perform and display data analysis in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Utilize various visualizations to explore data insights.
- **Data Upload**: Users can upload their own datasets in CSV format for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Basic data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Summary statistics, correlations, and other key metrics.
- **Modeling Capabilities**: Includes machine learning models (optional) to make predictions based on the data.

## Built With

- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating web applications.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for visualization (if applicable).
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models (if applicable).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed, preferably version 3.7 or above. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
https://github.com/manishdevdi/Data-Analysis-Web-Application.git

2. Install the required packages:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to run the project?
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install all the libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file with the command pip3 install -r requirements.txt
3. Open your terminal/command prompt from your project directory and run the file app.py by executing the command streamlit run app.py.
4. You will be automatically redirected the your localhost in brower where you can see you WebApp in live.

bash
streamlit run app.py
This will launch the application on a local server, which you can access at http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.

# Usage
- Upload a Dataset: Use the upload button to add your own dataset (CSV format).
- Data Overview: The app provides an overview of the dataset with basic details like shape, missing values, and data types.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data distribution, correlations, and relationships.
- Data Cleaning: Options for handling missing values and other basic cleaning operations.
- Machine Learning (Optional): If the dataset is compatible, apply predefined models to make predictions or classifications.
