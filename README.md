# Data Analysis Web Application

This repository contains a web application built with Streamlit in Python, designed to perform and display data analysis in an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Features Of Data Analysis Web App
- Supports **Multiple file formates**(csv, txt, xls, xlsx, ods, odt).
- Gives a **detailed overview** of your data.
- You have the option to **plot graphs** for your data.
- You can see **Outliers** in your data in a visulization way.
- You can **drop multiple columns** and **rename columns**.
- You can *drop* **multiple categorical Rows** and **Numerical Rows** by giving **multiple conditions**.
- Handling **Handling Missing Data**, **Merging On Index** and **Concatenating On Axis**
- You can **download/export** your edited data.

## Built With

- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating web applications.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries for visualization (if applicable).
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning models (if applicable).

## Getting Started
